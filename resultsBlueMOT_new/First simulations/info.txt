In these plots: 

Sr-88
Beam w's per axis are given in mm in filenames
Gradient: 55 G/cm
Detuning: -2 Gamma
Powers: (x,y,z) = (9.5,9.5,1.2) mW

Initial conditions : starting position always at the origin, starting velocities are random, taken from a uniform distribution
low_end_vel = 1 m/s
high_end_vel = 30 m/s
inits_blue = [(0,r.uniform(low_end_vel,high_end_vel),0,r.uniform(low_end_vel,high_end_vel),0,-r.uniform(low_end_vel,high_end_vel)) for q in range(num_init_vels)]
