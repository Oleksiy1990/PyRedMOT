Data going into the simulation in this folder: 
Detuning: -1 blueGamma 
 power X-beam: 0.0080 W 
 power Y-beam: 0.0080 W 
 power Z-beam: 0.0015 W 
Beam radius W_x: 0.0150 m 
 Beam radius W_y: 0.0150 m 
 Beam radius W_z: 0.0100 m 
B-field grad in radial directions: -0.5500 T/m 
Initial position: (x,y,z) = (-0.0866,-0.05,0) m , which is the center at the end of the short ZS tube 
Initial velocities: (vx,vy,vz) = (init_speed*sin(theta)cos(phi),init_speed*sin(theta)sin(phi),init_speed*cos(theta)) m/s 
where theta is taken from a uniform random distribution [90 deg, 95 deg] and phi from a uniform random distribution [25 deg, 35 deg]
